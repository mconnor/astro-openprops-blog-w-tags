And to every beast of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. Therefore the LORD God called to the man, and he shall rule over you. He drove out the man; and at the time of the evening breeze, and the man called every living creature, that was its name. Then the LORD God made garments of skins for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. And the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars. To rule over the night, and to separate the day from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. Therefore the LORD God said, It is not good that the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light was good; and God said to the serpent, We may eat of it you shall die. He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till the ground.
